						Patriot Porter is our darkest flagship brew, which prominently features a nearly forgotten ingredient called brown malt. The brown porter also features molasses and American bittering hops. This rich malt bill provides a depth of flavors and aromas, including milk chocolate, baked pretzel, and a number of other toasted flavors and aromas. <br>

					<p class="history">
						The brown porter was a beer style that originated in England, and had widespread success both there and in the United States.  Porter was the brewing industry’s contribution to the industrial revolution, utilizing new technologies and techniques to more quickly produce larger quantities of finished beer. History suggests that this beer was a favorite among London’s working class, hence the name Porter.  The first porter brewed in the US is claimed to have come from a brewery in Philadelphia in 1776.  In the US, the brown porter took on some recipe modifications, as a result of high cost and limited availability of supplies needed from England, mostly the roasted malts.  One of the new ingredients was molasses.  Our brown porter boasts a traditional malt bill, with the addition of the American molasses tradition and American hops.  The name is a nod to the American Revolution happening during the time that this great beer was first being brewed in the United States.
